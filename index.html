        This is the draft I used in learning JavaScript. I liked implementing as
        I learned. So, I used this page to run and and view my code. I only
        edited it today, 23/02/2022. <br />
        If you're on this site, esp as a beginner, you'll definately find it
        helpful as I have made it simplified step by step,

        <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
        <p>
          As you may already know, this webpage is written with HTML, styled
          with CSS, and the function is activated with some Javascript codes
          <br />
          <b>What do I mean?</b> <br />
          Web pages aren't just about displaying images and notes and wonderful
          designs for the viewer's eyes, it is also about interacting with the
          user.. getting feedbacks from the user and giving responses to the
          user. This user is now referrted to as the <b>"client".</b>
          <br />
          Moving forward, getting responses from a user can come from link
          clicks, using a button, imputing delivery details, giving feedbacks on
          a company's website, all meets just the eyes.
          <br />
          This website seeks to show you peeks of what you can do with
          Javascript, it's importance and why it is relevant for a developer
          especially a one from the Front End.

      <section>
        <p style="text-decoration: underline">
          <b>Explaining How Javascript Works</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          What I mean by functionality is simply the aability to do something,
          or make something actually work. There are many cases this can be
          implemented.. <br />
          Take for instance, buttons.. when created with just HTML and CSS,
          they're just dummies cos they actually don't do anything even after
          being clicked (well, except for buttons that have an a tag with a link
          inside)
        </p>
        <hr />

        <div class="js-example">
          <p>
            <b>For example:</b> <br />
            Click the buttons to get your answer
          </p>

          <p class="my-name">
            What's my name? <button onclick="nameAnswer()">Answer</button>
          </p>
          <p class="my-country">
            What country are you from?
            <button onclick="country()">Answer</button>
          </p>
          <p class="my-course">
            What is this about?
            <button onclick="course()">Answer</button> <br />
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Not just about clicking buttons, Javascript with the help of CSS can
          make animations as well. Some badass coders may not even need CSS to
          make these things.
          <br />
          Thanks to growth and inventions, frameworks like React.js and
          TypeScript have conme to make life easier and les strefful for
          developers. Don't fidget, you'll get there soon!

        <h3>DATA TYPES</h3>
        <p>
          NUMBERS... EG: let age = 21;
          STRINGS ... EG: let name = "Makis"; //NB: Strings are denoted with a double quotation ("") or a single quote ('')
          BOOLEAN ... It takes two values, can be true or false statement, yes or no, positive or negative. 
          UNDEFINED ... It is when a variable is created but nit assigned a value
        </p>
        
        <p>
          We have different ways of declaring variables, the var, let and const
        </p>
        <p>
          The <b>var</b> is a depreciated way of declaring variables.
          <b>let</b> and <b>const </b> were introduced in 2015 in the ES6
          (EcmaScript6) also known as ES2015. <br />
          <em>let </em>is used in block scoped functions. They are mutable, ie,
          its value can be re-assigned. On the other hand, <em>const</em> are
          function scoped and global scoped too. It's value are immutable, ie,
          it can <b>never</b> be changed through out the page once declared

        <!-- SECOND EXAMPLE  -->
        <section>
          <div class="js-example">
            <figure>
              <img
                src="imgs/camel_case_example.png"
                alt="a picture declaring a variable"
              />
              <figcaption>
                <p style="color: gray">
                  // Note: you can store numbers, figures, words, or even
                  another variable names. A word or set of words are denoted
                  with "" and are referred to as <b>strings</b>.

            Observe that the third variable was written <b>myName</b> rather
            than <b>myname</b> or <b>my-name</b>. The system of calling and
            naming vavriables is called the camelCase, where the first letter of
            the second word is capitalized. In the code written for this page,
            these variables are called and named. Like other languages, the
            Javascript codes can be seen in the Developer Tools. This is called
            the <b>console</b>. <br />
            Use (Ctrl + Shift + I => Windows) on your webpage to see the result!
            <br />
            The console.log() is one of the most popularly used syntax, for
            outputing results in the console // There are others you'll get to
            know more about as we proceed. <br />
