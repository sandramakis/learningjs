# learningjs
I made a repo on my learning path on a Zero to Expert Javascript Udemy Course. I made this into a blog with a detailed step by step learning I made. While on the site, check out the Developer Tools, there are codes there with descriptions. I believe this will be helpful to beginners and anyone who is wants to learn the basics of Javascript.
